## Swark

Swark is a VS Code extension that allows creating architecture diagrams from code automatically using large language models (LLMs).\
Swark is **directly integrated with GitHub Copilot**, and requires no authentication or API key.

### Use Cases

-   ðŸ”Ž **Learn a New Codebase**: Swark helps you quickly generate an architecture diagram of a repository, providing a high-level overview of the codebase without the need to manually explore files or folder structure. This allows you to focus on the areas most relevant to your work.
-   ðŸ“• **Documentation**: enhance your documentation with up-to-date architecture diagrams that are simple to create and require minimal engineering effort.
-   ðŸ§© **Visualize Dependencies**: a dependency graph of your repo can help you spot unwanted dependencies and suboptimal design.
-   âœ… **Test Coverage**: include your tests in Swark's input to visualize your test coverage and identify areas that may be missing.

## How it Works

1. **File Retrieval**: Swark retrieves code files within the chosen folder. Swark automatically adjusts the number of retrieved files to match the LLM max token limit.
2. **Prompt Building**: based on the retrieved files, Swark builds a prompt to generate an architecture diagram. The code files are included in the prompt, together with instructions on how to build the diagram.
3. **LLM Request**: Swark invokes LLM request to GitHub Copilot via VS Code [Language Model API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model).
4. **Diagram Preview**: upon a successful response, the diagram is presented. This is done by creating a markdown file that includes the diagram in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax and previewing it.

### Code Access and File Sharing

It's important to note that source code is **only shared with GitHub Copilot**, and with no other external APIs or providers.

## Requirements

-   **GitHub Copilot Subscription**: Swark is currently working directly with GitHub Copilot and requires an [active subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing) to work.
-   **Mermaid Markdown Preview**: in order to preview the diagram in VS Code you can install the [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension. Alternatively, you can copy the Mermaid code and paste it into any [Mermaid editor](https://mermaid.live/).

## Installation

Simply install Swark via the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=swark.swark).

## How to Use

1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette and run: **Swark: Create Architecture Diagram**.\
   Alternatively, you can use Swark's default keybindings: `cmd+shift+r` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+r` (Windows).
2. Select a folder to use in Swark's file search.
3. Within a few seconds, a tab will open displaying a preview of your architecture diagram.\
   Another tab will contain the diagram's code, which you can edit manually or copy for use in other tools.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

| Setting                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `swark.maxFiles`        | Max number of files to read.<br>The number of files read is also affected by the LLM max token limit.                                    |
| `swark.fileExtensions`  | List of file extensions to include in search.                                                                                            |
| `swark.excludePatterns` | List of glob patterns to exclude from file search.<br>Defaults include: `**/.*` for hidden files, `**/node_modules/**` for node modules. |
| `swark.languageModel`   | Language model to use for diagram generation.                                                                                            |

## Known Issues

### Mermaid Diagram Cycle

The LLM's output may occasionally generate a cycle in the Mermaid code, resulting in the following error:

```
Syntax error in text
mermaid version 11.4.0

Setting Node as parent of Node would create a cycle
```

This occurs when a parent and child node share the same name.\
To resolve this issue:

1. Re-run Swark to generate a new result.
2. Edit the diagram code manually by renaming the parent node to give it a unique name.
